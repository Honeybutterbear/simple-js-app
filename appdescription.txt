App Name:
GameStation

Concept:
An app where you can identify songs from games
Process: by typing in a few lyrics, searching for the song directly, typing in
the part or location of the game you heard the song, and maybe even
playing a snippit of the song if i can figure it out

Prototype:
Life Is strange 3

The Why: It can be hard to ID songs you like from a game, there are fourms
in reddit just for this. Personally, i love listening to music from games

Load items from somewhere:
A database of stored info related to each song i.e.
'scenic moment on haven springs bridge, life is strange 3'

display a list of all items:
Can select a game, see songs that were found
search for items: can search by part of game, lyrics, sound of song, genre
display a detailed view for an item: will show where you can hear the song
in game, whats happening in the scene, the artist info, where you can listen

Future Goals for app:
-- Live radio station playing songs from games i.e. 'music to study to'
-- logo design
-- Ask for video game suggestions online
